# Python-Data-Analysis
Perfromed Exploratory data analysis using python libraries such as numpy,pandas,matplotlib,seaborn.
It consists of three projects namely sales analysis, ipl data analysis and terrorism analysis.
The projects consist of many visualizations and insights which I got from the datasets.

In the analysis of meteorological data I was supposed to find how apparent temperature and humidity changed in the month of April for a period of 10 years(2006-2016)
I have analysed that for all the months for the given time period.
